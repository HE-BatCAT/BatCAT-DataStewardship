# Metadata Schema Change Workflow (v0.1)

This workflow describes how changes to BatCAT metadata kernels or profiles are handled.  
It is based on the VIMMP approach and open for partner feedback.

**Step 1. Submit Request**  
- Partner submits a request via GitHub Issue (Change Request template) or by email.  
- Request includes: what change, why, expected impact.

**Step 2. Triage (≤ 5 WD)**  
- SDO (NMBU) reviews, classifies (minor/major), assigns Data Owner.

**Step 3. Review/Decision**  
- Request is assessed, may be *approved*, *clarified*, or *rejected*.

**Step 4. Implementation**  
- If approved, Platform Contact implements in the system.

**Step 5. Review Check**  
- SDO verifies. Ontology contact consulted if meaning changes.

**Step 6. Release/Publish**  
- Change is released to all partners.

**Step 7. Log & Notify**  
- Entry added to [/log/decision-log.md](../log/decision-log.md).  
- Partners notified.

Indicative timescales: Triage ≤ 5 WD, Implementation ≤ 2 weeks, Review ≤ 1 week.
